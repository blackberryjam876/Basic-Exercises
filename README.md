# Basic-Exercises
In this repo, I will be implementing solutions to random Python exercise questions I come across on different online platforms (for fun!!). Students can freely use my code as reference material for their classes.
## Basic Python Implementation
* <code>unique.py</code> implements a method to print the input with the most unique and repeated characters from an array (list).
* <code>splitter.py</code> splits a string into 2 lists, separators and words. Main runs an input prompt to split and returns the lists.
* <code>island.py</code> counts the number of islands from binary mappings to land and water from 2D input arrays, making up a geo-grid.
